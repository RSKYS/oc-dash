## 🌍 Contributing to Translations (i18n)

We welcome community contributions to improve and expand internationalization (i18n) support!

### 📁 Translation Files Directory
All web dashboard translation files are located at:

[web/src/locales/](https://github.com/RSKYS/oc-dash/tree/master/web/src/locales)

Each language has its own JSON file (e.g., `en.json`, `it.json`, `zh.json`, `ru.json`, etc.).

### 🛠️ How to Contribute

1. Go to the [locales](https://github.com/RSKYS/oc-dash/tree/master/web/src/locales) directory.
2. Choose an existing language file to improve, or create a new `<lang>.json` file for a new language.
3. Add all required translation keys with proper JSON structure.
4. Make sure the JSON syntax is valid.

### 🔧 Update the Installer (Required for New Languages)

After adding a new `<lang>.json` file, you **must update the `install.sh` file**:

Open 👉 [install.sh](https://github.com/RSKYS/oc-dash/blob/master/install.sh)

Find the line that defines supported languages, and add your new language in the same format, comma-separated.

Example (adding Spanish):

**LANGUAGES=en:English,it:Italiano,zh-tw:中文(繁體),zh-cn:中文(简体),ru:Русский,fa:فارسی,ar:العربية,es:Español**

Contributing translations and updating the installer helps ensure the dashboard supports users around the world.
